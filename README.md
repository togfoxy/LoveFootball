Instructions
============

Starting a campaign
===================

Start a new save game by giving your team and your savefile a name. A default name will be provided but you can type over it.

Team summary
============

The team summary shows the players on your team and their key stats. Make note of your best and worst players.

Tournament brackets
===================

Your team is placed in a knock-out tournament. When it is your turn to play, score a touchdown as fast as you can. If you score a touch down faster than your bracket buddy then you will advance to the next round.

Progress tournament
===================

When viewing the tournament brackets, click once to see the AI's score. Click through quickly to get to your turn. Watch the season develop as each bracket is played out and teams advance or get eliminated.

Playing your round
==================

You will be placed on the field when the tournament progresses to your turn.

Wait for the players to line up on the line-of-scrimmage.

Wait until you hear the Quarterback shout "GO".

Use the NUMPAD keys (+ NUM5) or WADX (+ S) keys or arrow keys (+ SPACE) to move the Quarterback around the field.

Use the mouse to click anywhere on the field to throw the ball.

Use NUMPAD-5 or S key or SPACE BAR to advance time.

Hold the CNTRL key to display an overlay

You can only control the Quarterback. The rest of the players are bots.

You get one drive. One chance. Make it count.

Tournament Score
================

Every team in the tournament plays against a random AI team. Teams in the tournament do NOT play each other - they play AI.

Teams that play well against the AI will advance. Teams that play poorly will be eliminated.

Scoring a touchdown beats a team that doesn't score a touchdown.

Scoring a touchdown in a few plays beats a team that takes longer to score a touchdown (number of plays).

If both teams fail to score a touchdown then the team that got closest to the goal eliminates the other team.

Game tips
=========

When the ball is snapped, side step left or right and allow your running back (RB) room to charge forward.

Use the NUMPAD or WADX keys or arrow keys to move around and avoid opposing players.

Keep your Quarterback away from the opposing team.

When you move the mouse pointer around the field, a circle will shrink and expand showing you where the ball might land. 

Throw distance affects accuracy. Short throws will be more accurate than long bombs.

When you click the field with the mouse, a blue circle will show where you clicked. The Quarterback will instantly throw the ball.

Throw the ball to your own team - but find someone that is open and can catch the ball safely.

Quarterbacks have throwing accuracy. Factor this into your ball placement.

If the ball lands too close to the opposing team then the ball will be "knocked down" by that team.

Some players are good at catching and others are not.

Red dots mean that player has been tackled and is on the ground (inactive). They won't move or contribute further to this play.

When your front line collapses you are about to be rushed (sacked). You'll need to decide to a) run with the ball or b) throw the ball to an open player.

Make the right decision and your team will score.
