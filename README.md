Instructions
============

Wait for the players to line up on the line-of-scrimmage.

When you here the Quarterback shout "GO".

Use the NUMPAD keys or WADX keys to move the Quarterback around the field.

Use the mouse to click anywhere on the field to throw the ball.

Use NUMPAD-5 or S key to advance time.

You can only control the Quarterback. The rest of the players are bots.


Tips
====

The red circle shows where your Quarterback will run to. Use the NUMPAD or WADX keys to move to a new location.

When you click the field with the mouse, a blue circle will show where you clicked. The Quarterback will instantly throw the ball.

Keep your Quarterback away from the opposing team.

When the ball is snapped, side step left or right and allow your running back (RB) room to charge forward.

Red dots mean that player has been tackled and is on the ground (inactive). They won't move or contribute further to this play.

When your front line collapses you are about to be rushed (sacked). You'll need to decide to a) run with the ball or b) throw the ball to an open player.

Make the right decision and your team will score.
